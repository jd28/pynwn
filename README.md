# pynwn

```
    Thus far I have proceeded in a theme
    Renewed with no kind auspices:--to feel
    We are not what we have been, and to deem
    We are not what we should be,--and to steel
    The heart against itself; and to conceal,
    With a proud caution, love, or hate, or aught,--
    Passion or feeling, purpose, grief or zeal,--
    Which is the tyrant spirit of our thought,
Is a stern task of soul:--No matter,--it is taught.
    -- George Gordon, Lord Byron, Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, Canto the Third, CXI

pynwn is now a wrapper (or will be) around [libnw](https://github.com/jd28/libnw).  Older versions can be found on `master-obsolete` and `develop-obsolete`.  Getting CI going, first.. then the rest.
